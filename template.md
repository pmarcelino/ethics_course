## Introduction

### Opening Hook & Session Framing

{Provocative scenario, engaging hook, or startling fact related to the topic. (e.g., What if you could predict tomorrow’s sales, the price of a house, or even your next grade—just by drawing a straight line? It might sound too simple to be true, but that’s exactly the idea behind a powerful tool used across data science and business.)}
{Welcome message mentioning the lecture title. (e.g., Hi, and welcome to this lesson on "Linear Regression".)}
{Lecture roadmap to preview what will be covered. (e.g., In the next few minutes we’ll tackle what is linear regression, starting with its formula, then moving to some application examples, and finally mentioning some of its limitations.)}
{State the learning objective. Focus on a single learning objective, the most important one. (e.g., By the end, you’ll be able to explain what linear regression is.)}

## Body

{Different rhetorical structures are used (e.g., problem-solution, listicle, chronological, cause-effect)}

## Conclusion

### Recap & What’s Next

{Recap the key takeaways. (e.g., In this lesson, we learned about linear regression, a simple but powerful tool used to predict one thing based on another by drawing a straight line through data points. While it requires some assumptions to be true in order to work, its clarity and transparency make it invaluable both as a predictive tool and as a means for scientific explanation..)}
{Introduce the next lecture. (e.g., In our next session, we’ll dive into regularized versions of linear regression—like Lasso and Ridge regression—that address some of the limitations of the basic model and help us deal with complex, high-dimensional data.)}
{Close with a positive message. (e.g., Hope you enjoyed this lesson on linear regression. See you in the next session!)}
