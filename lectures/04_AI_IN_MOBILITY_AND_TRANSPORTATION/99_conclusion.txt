All right, so that wraps up our deep dive into how AI is actually being used across the mobility landscape. We’ve seen how the road ecosystem is changing, how AI powers everything from passenger and freight transport, to smart infrastructures, shared rides, trains, ports—you name it. Oh, and don’t forget intermodal transport, where different modes connect in ways that just weren’t possible before. It’s a lot, right? But hopefully you’re starting to see how these systems all interact and build on one another.

Now, coming up, we’ll switch gears a bit. Next module, we’re going to get real about the benefits, challenges, and yes, the risks that come with applying AI in mobility and transport markets. We’ll look at what AI promises, where it falls short, and what kind of issues—ethical and practical—we need to watch for. So, lots to think about, but for now, take a breather. When you’re ready, I’ll see you in the next module!
