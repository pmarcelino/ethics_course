Hey everyone, and welcome back. After exploring the railway ecosystem and other guided transport systems, it’s time to shift to a different—but equally vital—part of mobility: ports, maritime operations, and inland waterways. If you picture ports as just big ships and stacks of containers, think again. These hubs are becoming smarter, greener, and far more efficient, thanks to digitalization and AI.

Let’s start with a headline change: autonomous vessels. They may sound futuristic, but they’re already here. The Yara Birkeland, the world’s first all-electric, crewless cargo ship, uses sensors, AI, and robotics to navigate without a captain on deck. In Finland, the autonomous ferry Falco has shown how AI can make passenger transport safer and more reliable. These aren’t just prototypes—they’re early signs of a wider shift in how we move goods and people over water.

Running a ship is more than steering—it’s balancing fuel, weather, cargo, and schedules. AI-based route optimization now crunches vast amounts of data, from ocean currents to engine status, adjusting speed and path in real time. Think of it as a super-smart GPS that also monitors your vehicle’s health and tells you how to save fuel. The benefits: lower costs, fewer emissions, and more reliable arrivals.

Busy ports and waterways are like constantly shifting puzzles, with vessels large and small competing for space. AI-driven maritime traffic management works like air traffic control for ships—predicting bottlenecks, flagging hazards, and recommending routes instantly. This keeps goods moving smoothly and reduces the risk of accidents.

At the dock, equipment like cranes, cargo loaders, and engines is the lifeblood of operations. Downtime can ripple through the whole supply chain. That’s where predictive maintenance comes in. Platforms like Wärtsilä’s analyze sensor data to detect issues before they become breakdowns—like your car warning you weeks in advance that the brakes need replacing. This keeps operations running, extends equipment life, and cuts emergency repair costs.

Pulling all this together is the concept of the smart port. Leading examples, such as Rotterdam and Aveiro, integrate AI into every layer of operations—from managing crane activity to scheduling trucks and allocating berths. The results: faster turnarounds, more efficient use of resources, and a strong drive toward sustainability through reduced energy use and emissions.

So, to sum up, the port ecosystem and waterway networks are being transformed from the inside out. We’re talking about safer, cleaner, and more adaptable systems—powered by AI and data. Looking ahead, our next session will explore how these maritime innovations connect with intermodal and multimodal transport, tying together different modes into one seamless mobility web. Stay tuned for that, and thanks for joining today.
