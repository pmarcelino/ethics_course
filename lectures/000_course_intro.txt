Hey everyone, and welcome! I’m excited to kick off our course: “AI Challenges and Ethical Considerations in Urban Mobility.”

If you’ve ever wondered how AI is reshaping the way we move through cities—and what ethical questions that raises—you’re definitely in the right place.

We’ll start by unpacking what AI is and how it’s already transforming transport systems, from shared scooters and ride-hailing apps to freight trains and port logistics. Together, we’ll explore what these changes mean for people, cities, and the environment across all major mobility ecosystems—roads, rail, waterways, and beyond.

The promise is huge: smarter traffic systems, cleaner and more sustainable transport, and mobility that’s accessible to more people. But alongside that potential come real risks and challenges. Issues like privacy, fairness, accountability, and safety must be addressed if we want AI in mobility to truly benefit everyone.

That’s why ethics will be at the heart of our discussions. We’ll ask: How can AI in urban mobility be transparent, safe, and rights-respecting? What does responsible AI look like in practice? And how do legal and regulatory frameworks guide us beyond simple compliance toward real accountability?

Throughout the course, you’ll gain practical frameworks, examine real-world cases, and engage with the latest debates on balancing innovation with ethical responsibility. So whether you’re a policymaker, technologist, or simply curious about the future of urban life, you’ll find plenty to explore here. Ready? Let’s dive in!
