Hey everyone, welcome back! Last time, we explored just how transformative AI can be for urban mobility—everything from handling the challenges of rapidly growing cities, to the global shifts in how we move around, and of course, why we need strong guidelines to keep things ethical, transparent, and responsible. We also touched on the crucial role of regulation in all this, right? So now, let’s get more concrete. In this module, we’re going to zoom in on the actual mobility and transport markets where all this AI action is happening. We’ll start with the road ecosystem—think smart traffic systems and autonomous vehicles—then shift gears to railways and other guided systems, before heading out to ports, maritime, and inland waterways. Along the way, we’ll see how AI is shaping each sector, and what unique challenges pop up in these environments. So, let’s get started and see how these pieces fit together in the real world!
