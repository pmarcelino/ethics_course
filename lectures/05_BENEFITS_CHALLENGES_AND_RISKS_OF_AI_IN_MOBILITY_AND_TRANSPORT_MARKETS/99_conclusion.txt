And that brings us to the end of this module. So, just to recap, we’ve explored both the promise and the pitfalls of using AI in urban mobility. We looked at how AI can make transport systems more efficient and accessible, but also talked through the technical and social hurdles—plus the real risks, from bias to unintended consequences—that can come along for the ride. It’s a complex mix, right? Well, in the next module, we’re going to shift gears and focus squarely on the ethical principles that should guide AI in this space. We’ll dive into ideas like transparency, accountability, and human supervision—what it actually means to build trustworthy AI for our cities. We’ll also touch on equity, privacy, legal compliance, and even sustainability. So if you’ve been wondering how to turn these high-level values into practical guardrails for AI in mobility, you’re in the right place. Let’s keep going!
