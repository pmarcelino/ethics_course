All right, so let’s take a step back and look at what we’ve covered in this module. We’ve been digging into the core principles for using AI in urban mobility in a way that’s not just smart, but actually ethical and responsible. We’ve talked about the importance of transparency—making sure people can understand how decisions are made—and explainability, so it’s not all a black box. Then there’s accountability, human supervision, and making space for intervention when tech goes off track. We also looked at protecting privacy, keeping things safe, making sure systems are fair, sustainable, and legal, and always respecting the autonomy of users.

Now, where do we go from here? Well, in the next module, we’ll zoom out and look at the big-picture strategies: how do you actually build an ethical and strategic approach to AI? We’ll dig into setting objectives, identifying risks, collaborating with regulators, and making sure you’re not just ticking boxes, but creating real impact. So, get ready to connect all the dots and see how these principles come together in practice!
