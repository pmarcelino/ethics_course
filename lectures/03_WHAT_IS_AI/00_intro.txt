>> Hi everyone, welcome back! Last time, we took a whirlwind tour through the different mobility and transport markets—remember how we broke down the road ecosystem, dived into railways and guided systems, and even explored ports and waterways? It was a lot to take in, but hopefully you’re starting to see just how complex and interconnected urban mobility really is.

Now, shifting gears a bit, this module is all about a big question: What is AI? We hear the term everywhere, but what does it actually mean, especially in the context of urban mobility? We’re going to unpack the basics—think definitions, core concepts, and a bit of history to set the stage. You don’t need a computer science degree for this part; we’ll keep things approachable and practical. By the end, you’ll have a solid foundation, so when we dig into the challenges and ethics later, you’ll know exactly what's under the hood. Let’s get started!
