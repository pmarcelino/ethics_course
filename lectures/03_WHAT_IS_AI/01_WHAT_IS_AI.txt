Hey everyone, glad you could join me today as we kick off our journey into Artificial Intelligence, or just AI for short. Now, I’m guessing most of you have heard the term “AI” floating around—on the news, in movies, or maybe from that voice assistant on your phone that somehow knows your favorite coffee order. But what actually is AI? And why does it seem to be everywhere all of a sudden? That’s exactly what we’re going to unpack.

Picture AI as a kind of smart helper—a machine designed to take on tasks we usually connect with human intelligence, like solving problems, understanding language, recognizing images, learning from mistakes, even making decisions. The big ambition? To create systems that can, in some sense, think—or at least behave—in ways that resemble how we reason, adapt, and respond to the world.

So, how do we actually make a machine that can “think”? One major pathway is Machine Learning. Imagine teaching a dog a trick: reward it for doing the right thing, and over time, it learns. Machine Learning works in a similar way—except instead of treats, we feed a computer massive amounts of data. It identifies patterns, improves over time, and can adapt to new information without us giving step-by-step instructions. Dig a bit deeper, and you’ll find Deep Learning, which uses these nifty things called neural networks—structures inspired by the human brain, only they’re made out of math and code instead of neurons.

Now, if you’ve ever had a chatbot answer your question or used real-time translation, you’ve experienced Natural Language Processing, or NLP. This is AI’s way of understanding—and producing—human language. Behind the scenes, large language models and other algorithms are trained on enormous datasets to answer questions, write text, or hold conversations in a way that feels surprisingly natural.

AI isn’t just locked up in labs—it’s already out in the wild. It’s sorting your emails, recommending your next favorite show, translating signs on your travels, and sometimes even driving cars. In short, AI is quietly shaping the way we live and work, often without us pausing to notice.

Now, with all this power comes great responsibility. In Europe, for instance, regulators define an AI system as any machine-based setup that operates with some degree of autonomy—making predictions, generating outputs, or taking actions that influence the world. Two key ideas here are 1) Autonomy – meaning, the system acts without constant human control, and 2) Inference – meaning, the system uses data to produce conclusions or decisions. It’s also helpful to spot the difference between Predictive AI, which tries to guess what might happen next, and Generative AI, which creates something new—like an image or a story. Rules in Europe are paying special attention to these creative systems, making sure they’re built and used in ways that are safe, transparent and fair.

So, just remember: AI isn’t just a buzzword. It’s a rapidly evolving blend of technology and human-like thinking, packed with opportunities and responsibilities. Thanks for tuning in!
