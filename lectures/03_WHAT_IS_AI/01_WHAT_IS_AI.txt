Hi everyone, glad you could join me today as we kick off our journey into Artificial Intelligence, or just AI for short. Now, if you’re anything like me, you’ve probably heard the term “AI” tossed around everywhere—from news headlines to your phone’s voice assistant. But what exactly is AI? And why is everyone suddenly talking about it? Well, let’s unpack that together.

Picture AI as a kind of smart helper, one that’s designed to take on tasks we typically associate with human smarts—like figuring out a puzzle, chatting in natural language, learning from mistakes, or even sensing the world around it. In other words, AI is all about building machines that can, in some sense, “think” for themselves. The big dream? To create systems that seem to reason and adapt just like we do.

So, how do we actually build a machine that seems to think? That’s where the magic starts. One major approach is something called Machine Learning. Imagine teaching a dog a new trick: you reward it each time it does the right thing, and over time, it gets better. Machine Learning is sort of like that, except instead of treats, we feed computers lots of data. They learn patterns and improve, often without us telling them exactly what to do at every step. Dig a bit deeper, and you’ll find Deep Learning, which uses these nifty things called neural networks—structures inspired by the human brain, only they’re made out of math and code instead of neurons.

Now, if you’ve ever chatted with a bot or had your phone transcribe your speech, you’ve bumped into another flavor of AI: Natural Language Processing, or NLP. Think of NLP as the translator that helps computers make sense of—and even produce—human language. Behind the scenes, there are models at play, like neural networks or giant language models. These are trained on mountains of text, learning how to answer questions, complete sentences, or even write stories.

But AI isn’t just locked up in labs—it’s already out in the wild. It’s sorting your emails, recommending your next favorite show, translating signs on your travels, and sometimes even driving cars. In short, AI is quietly shaping the way we live and work, often without us pausing to notice.

Now, with all this power, it’s no surprise that people are asking, “How do we make sure AI is used responsibly?” For example, in Europe, there are new definitions and rules in play. Regulators define an “AI system” as any machine-based setup that can operate with some independence—making predictions or decisions based on data, often aiming to affect the world around it. The big ideas here? Autonomy—systems acting on their own—and inference—using data to generate smart outputs.

It’s also helpful to spot the difference between Predictive AI, which tries to guess what might happen next, and Generative AI, which creates something new—like an image or a story. Rules in Europe are paying special attention to these creative systems, making sure they’re built and used in ways that are safe and fair.

So, as we set out on this module, just remember: AI isn’t just a buzzword. It’s a rapidly evolving blend of technology and human-like thinking, packed with opportunities and responsibilities. I’m excited to explore it with you. Thanks for tuning in.
