Hi everyone, glad to see you back. Last time, we took a closer look at the risks and challenges that AI brings into the world of mobility and transport—those double-edged swords of promise and potential pitfalls. Today, though, I want to zoom out a bit and talk about the institutions steering this ship—specifically, the Mobility and Transport Authority, or AMT, and just how central its role is in keeping AI on track within transport markets.

So, let’s get our bearings. The AMT isn’t just some advisory board—it’s got real legal clout, thanks to its foundations in Law no. 67/2013 and Decree Law no. 78/2014. What does this actually mean? Well, think of AMT as the referee and the architect rolled into one. Its reach goes far and wide: from city buses and railways to ports, ferries, and even the nuts and bolts of infrastructure itself. This broad mandate means AMT shapes not just the rules of the game, but the very field on which it’s played.

Now, you might be wondering, what does AMT actually do with all that authority? It’s more than just waving a whistle. AMT is a regulator, a supervisor, an inspector, and, when necessary, it has the teeth to enforce the rules. Protecting the public is at the heart of its mission—making sure every passenger, whether hopping on a tram or booking a rideshare, is safe and treated fairly. But that’s just one side of the story. The AMT is also the gatekeeper for fair competition. It’s there to make sure big players don’t crowd out the little ones, and that innovative newcomers—think AI-driven apps or new mobility startups—have a fair shot to shake things up.

But what’s really driving all this? At its core, the AMT is working toward a transport system that’s for everyone: efficient, safe, green, digital, and open to all. Imagine a city where no neighborhood gets left out, where every trip—no matter how short or long—is protected by high standards and smart, forward-thinking policies. Every decision AMT makes is filtered through not just a legal lens, but an environmental, economic, and social one as well.

Here’s another key piece: AMT doesn’t work in isolation. Its work fits into a much bigger puzzle—aligning with global efforts like the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda and the European Green Deal. By making sure local rules line up with international ones, AMT helps push mobility toward a future that’s sustainable and ethical, especially as AI becomes more and more a part of how we get around.

And it doesn’t stop there. If you look at AMT’s 2024 Activity Plan, you’ll see a real push toward updating regulations so they stay ahead of the curve, opening doors for digital and AI-powered transport. Think about AI optimizing delivery routes or making public transport smarter and more responsive. AMT’s job is to nurture these innovations, but never to lose sight of safety, fairness, or the public interest.

So, to pull it all together: AMT wears a lot of hats—enforcer, innovator, protector—and its approach to regulating AI in mobility is all about balance. The goal is simple, but not easy: making sure technology serves people, not the other way around.

Coming up next, we'll explore the nuts and bolts of what it actually means for AI in transport to be ethical, transparent, trustworthy, and responsible.
