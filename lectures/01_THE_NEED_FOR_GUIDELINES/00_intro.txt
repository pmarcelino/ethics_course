In this very first module, we’re going to set the stage for everything that follows by digging into why we actually need guidelines when it comes to AI in urban mobility. Now, you might have noticed that AI is everywhere these days—sometimes it feels like every city or transport company is racing to adopt new systems. But what’s really at stake here? Well, first off, we’ll look at how AI can be totally transformative—think smarter traffic management, cleaner transportation, and more accessible cities. Sounds great, right? But, as you’ll see, urbanization itself comes with a whole host of challenges, and AI isn’t a magic fix. We’ll also zoom out and check out some global shifts in how people move around, and then ask: can AI really deliver on the promise of more sustainable and efficient mobility? Of course, we can’t talk about all the good without facing the risks and challenges. So, we’ll unpack those too. And just as importantly, we’ll introduce you to the role that organizations play in setting the rules of the road for AI in mobility. Finally, we’ll wrap up with a look at what it takes to make AI ethical, transparent, and trustworthy in this space. So, lots to cover—let’s get started!
