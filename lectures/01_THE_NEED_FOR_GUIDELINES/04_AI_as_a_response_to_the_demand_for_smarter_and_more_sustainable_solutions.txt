Hi everyone, glad to have you back. Picking up from our last conversation about the sweeping changes AI is bringing to mobility worldwide, today we’re going to zero in on a really pivotal question: Why is AI seen as the answer to our growing need for smarter and more sustainable solutions—particularly in the realm of transport and mobility?

Let’s take a step back for a moment. Picture a city skyline that’s always expanding—new neighborhoods springing up, more people moving in, and streets busier than ever. With this kind of growth comes a new set of headaches: longer traffic jams, worsening air quality, and of course, the ever-present pressure to do something meaningful about climate change. But that’s not the whole picture. People’s expectations are changing too. These days, we all expect our journeys—whether by bus, train, or ride-share—to be smooth, quick, and green. We want options that fit into our lives seamlessly and don’t cost the earth, literally or figuratively.

Now, how do you tackle challenges that are this tangled and high-stakes? This is where AI steps in, front and center. The real power of AI lies in its ability to sift through mountains of data, spot trends that would take humans years to notice, and make decisions on the fly. That’s why the transport sector has really taken to AI—because it’s uniquely equipped to deal with the scale and complexity of modern mobility.

Let’s make this more concrete. Across every form of transport—whether it’s cars, trains, planes, or ships—AI is hard at work behind the scenes. Imagine a self-driving car that can read the road and react in the blink of an eye, or a train system that uses AI to schedule maintenance before things go wrong, saving time and money. Even the way goods move around the globe is changing, with AI-powered logistics platforms finding the smartest routes and schedules. And here's the thing: these innovations aren’t just making things faster or cheaper. They’re helping cut down emissions, make travel safer, and offer better service to everyone.

Given these benefits, it’s no surprise that policymakers are keen to keep this momentum going. Take Europe, for example. The European Commission has put AI right at the heart of its Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy, aiming not just to lead in tech, but to do so responsibly. It’s not about rolling out every shiny new gadget; it’s about setting high standards and building trust so people feel confident in these new systems.

To get there, though, the right environment is key. That means clear rules, support for research, and places where new ideas can be safely tested—think of the Commission’s Flagship Initiative 7 as a sort of launchpad for responsible AI innovation in transport.

At the end of the day, all of these efforts are pointing toward a future where mobility is smarter, greener, and works for everyone. The European approach is closely tied to big-picture goals like the UN’s 2030 Agenda and the European Green Deal, both focused on making life better and more sustainable for all.

So, to wrap up, the drive for smarter, more sustainable solutions is really shaking up how we move around and move things. AI is a huge part of making that happen—helping us do more with less, and do it better. Of course, this isn’t the whole story. Next time, we’ll dig into the risks and challenges that come along with this tech revolution. Looking forward to that conversation.
