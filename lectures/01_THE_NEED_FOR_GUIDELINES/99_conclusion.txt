Alright, so let’s take a moment and recap what we’ve just covered in this module. We started by looking at how AI is truly reshaping urban mobility—think smarter transport systems, more sustainable solutions, and all the ways cities are changing globally. But, as we saw, it’s not all smooth sailing. There are real risks and challenges, right? That’s where the need for strong guidelines and ethical frameworks comes in. We talked about how AMT steps in to regulate this space and why building trust, transparency, and responsibility into AI systems really matters—especially when people’s daily commutes are at stake. 

Now, looking ahead, we’re going to zoom in on the actual mobility and transport markets themselves. So, we’ll explore the road ecosystem, dig into railways and guided systems, and even set sail into ports and inland waterways. It’s all about seeing how these concepts play out in specific sectors. Alright, let’s jump in!
