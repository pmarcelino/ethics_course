That brings us to the end of this module, so let’s take a quick moment to recap what we covered, across the major ecosystems that keep mobility running. We began with the road network, looking at how vehicles, infrastructure, and people interact on our streets—and how AI is reshaping everything from traffic management to shared rides. Then we shifted to railways and guided transport, where predictive maintenance, automation, and cross-border coordination are redefining efficiency and safety. Finally, we explored ports, maritime operations, and inland waterways—the often-overlooked backbone of global trade—where AI is transforming ships, docks, and logistics into smarter, cleaner, more connected systems.

Stepping back, what we’ve seen is that transport isn’t a set of isolated silos. It’s a complex, interdependent web—roads linking homes and cities, rails connecting regions, and waterways tying us to global markets. Each system has its own players, technologies, and challenges, but all of them increasingly depend on AI to stay efficient, sustainable, and resilient.

Coming up in the next module, we’re going to get real about what AI promises, where it falls short, and what kind of issues—ethical and practical—we need to watch for. Looking forward to that!
