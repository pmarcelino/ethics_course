Alright, thanks for joining me again. Last time, we got into the nitty-gritty of strategy and alignment—why it matters to get everyone on the same page before diving into any big AI project. Now, let’s roll up our sleeves and talk about the next step: getting super clear on your objectives and needs. If strategy is the roadmap, objectives are the actual destinations you want to reach.

Let me put it this way: imagine you’re planning a cross-country trip. You wouldn’t just hop in the car and drive aimlessly, right? You’d pick where you want to end up—maybe the Grand Canyon, maybe New York City. In the same way, when you start an AI project, you need to spell out exactly what success looks like. Are you trying to cut down on commute times, boost accessibility for people with mobility challenges, or maybe slash emissions from city buses? Whatever it is, make it concrete. Vague goals like “improve transportation” just don’t cut it—you need targets you can actually measure.

And here’s a little secret: those metrics you pick will shape your whole project. If your objective is to reduce wait times, you’ll watch the data like a hawk and tweak things until riders notice a difference. If you skip this step, it’s like driving without a map—you might move, but you’re not getting anywhere meaningful.

Now, before you race ahead with the latest AI tool, take a minute to ask: is AI really the answer here? Sometimes, old-fashioned solutions work just fine. Maybe a better bus schedule or more bike lanes could solve your problem without all the bells and whistles. It’s not about being flashy—it’s about being effective and thoughtful. If AI is the right tool, great, but let’s make sure we’re not just chasing the trend.

Once you’ve landed on the right approach, keep your eyes on the people you’re serving. The end goal shouldn’t be just to roll out a shiny new system, but to make life better for actual users—commuters, cyclists, families trying to get across town. Think about how your AI project will show up in their daily lives. Will buses arrive more reliably? Will routes be easier to understand? The more directly you can link your objectives to real-world improvements, the more buy-in you’ll get from the community.

And don’t forget the bigger picture. With urban projects, environmental impact is huge. If your AI solution saves energy or cuts pollution, track that and share it. People care about sustainability, and being transparent about your progress—good or bad—builds trust.

But let’s not leave anyone behind. Equity matters. Make sure your objectives account for everyone, especially people who’ve traditionally had fewer options—whether that’s seniors, people with disabilities, or folks in underserved neighborhoods. Check in regularly to make sure your project is living up to those promises.

Last but not least, keep ethics at the center of it all. Think of it as your project’s moral compass. Are you being fair? Are you protecting privacy? Are you open to changing course if things aren’t working out as planned?

So, to bring it all together: crystal-clear objectives and a strong sense of need are what will keep your AI project grounded and genuinely useful. Next up, we’re going to dig into the risks that can pop up along the way—and how to tackle them head-on. Looking forward to that conversation.
