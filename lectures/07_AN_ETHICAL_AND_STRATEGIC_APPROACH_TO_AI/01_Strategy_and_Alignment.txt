Alright, so here we are, right at the start of our module, and the first stop on our journey is “Strategy and Alignment.” Before we get into the nuts and bolts of objectives and needs, it’s important to zoom out and get a sense of how all the puzzle pieces fit together. Why does this matter? Well, I think of it like planning a road trip. You wouldn’t just hop in the car and start driving, right? You need a map, a sense of where you’re going, and some idea of what you’ll need along the way. That’s really what strategy and alignment are all about—making sure your organization has a clear direction and that everyone’s rowing in the same direction.

Let’s kick things off with the idea of an AI strategy. Picture this as your organization’s playbook. It’s not just a list of fancy tech you want to try out. Instead, it’s about spelling out your purpose—why you’re bringing AI into the mix, what you actually want to achieve, and which areas you’re going to prioritize. Maybe your city wants to make public transit more reliable, or perhaps you’re hoping to reduce congestion downtown. Whatever the goal, it needs to be crystal clear in your strategy document.

But hang on, there’s more to it. A great strategy doesn’t just focus on the bright spots. You also need to be upfront about the scope—and that means recognizing both the opportunities and the bumps in the road. For example, maybe AI can make traffic flow smoother, but what about potential hiccups, like data privacy concerns or unintended bias in routing? It’s kind of like packing an umbrella in your suitcase even if the forecast looks sunny—you want to be ready for what might come up.

Now, one thing I want to stress is that a strategy isn’t something you write once and forget. Cities change, technology shifts, and new policies can pop up out of nowhere. That’s why it’s so important to revisit and refresh your strategy regularly—ideally every year. Imagine if a city was still using a plan from a decade ago to manage today’s traffic chaos. It just wouldn’t hold up.

Alright, so you’ve got your strategy written down. What happens next? Well, here’s where the magic of collaboration comes in. Regular multidisciplinary reviews are key. This is your chance to bring together people from all corners—engineers, policy folks, community representatives, and even legal experts. Each group spots different issues, and when you get them all talking, you catch blind spots much earlier. It’s a bit like having a pit crew when you’re racing—the more eyes on the car, the quicker you catch a loose bolt.

And let’s not overlook the importance of tracking your progress. If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it. So, define those metrics. Are you actually cutting wait times? Are commuters happy? Are there fewer complaints about privacy? Keeping tabs on these numbers helps you know if you’re on the right track or if it’s time to steer in a new direction.

So, to wrap up, strategy and alignment aren’t just checkboxes—they’re ongoing habits that help keep your AI projects relevant, ethical, and truly impactful. In our next session, we’ll roll up our sleeves and look at how to set meaningful objectives and dig into the needs driving your strategy. Looking forward to seeing you there!
