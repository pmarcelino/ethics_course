Welcome to our first stop in this module. Before diving into risks, privacy, or legal rules, we need to start with the foundation—strategy and alignment—and how that naturally flows into setting clear objectives and needs. Think of it like planning a road trip: you don’t just hop in the car and drive. You need a map, a destination, and an idea of what you’ll need along the way.

Your AI strategy is your organization’s playbook. It’s not a wish list of tech experiments; it’s a focused plan that explains why you’re bringing AI into the mix, what you want to achieve, and where to prioritize effort. Maybe you want to make public transport more reliable, cut congestion, or lower emissions. Whatever the aim, it must be crystal clear—and documented.

A good strategy is honest about both opportunities and challenges. Sure, AI might smooth traffic flow, but it could also raise privacy concerns or introduce bias in routing. Like packing an umbrella for a sunny forecast, you want to prepare for those bumps in the road. And don’t treat strategy as a one-off document. Cities evolve, tech shifts, and new policies emerge, so revisit it regularly—at least once a year.

Alignment comes from bringing the right people into the process. Regular multidisciplinary reviews—engineers, policy makers, community reps, legal experts—help you spot blind spots early. It’s like having a pit crew in a race: more eyes on the vehicle means faster fixes.

Once the strategy is in place, it’s time to define your objectives—your actual destinations. Vague goals like “improve transportation” won’t cut it. Make them measurable: reduce wait times by 15%, boost accessibility for seniors, cut bus emissions by 20%. These targets will shape your entire project and give you benchmarks to track progress.

And here’s an important checkpoint: is AI even the right tool? Sometimes a better bus schedule or new bike lanes will solve the problem faster and cheaper. The right solution is the one that works, not the flashiest one.

Keep your focus on real-world impact. How will commuters, cyclists, and families notice the difference? Will buses be more reliable? Routes easier to understand? Link your objectives to tangible improvements people can see and feel.

Also think bigger: if your AI solution saves energy or cuts pollution, measure it and share the results. People value sustainability, and transparency builds trust. And don’t forget equity—make sure your objectives benefit everyone, especially underserved groups, and check regularly to ensure you’re delivering.

Finally, ethics should be your moral compass. Are you fair? Protecting privacy? Ready to change course if things don’t work?

In short, strategy and alignment give you direction, and clear objectives keep you on course. Together, they lay the groundwork for AI projects that are relevant, ethical, and genuinely impactful.

Next up, we’re going to dig into the risks that can pop up along the way—and how to tackle them head-on. Looking forward to that!
