Hi everyone, glad to have you joining for the start of this module. Today, we’re wading into a topic that’s easy to oversimplify but actually has a lot more layers than most people realize: compliance that isn’t fully captured by the AI Regulation. Now, if you’re thinking, “Wait, isn’t the EU’s AI Regulation supposed to be the big, all-encompassing rulebook for AI?”—well, that’s only part of the story, and that’s exactly what we’re going to unpack together.

So, let’s set the scene. Imagine you’re running a smart mobility service in Lisbon—maybe an app that predicts bus arrivals using AI, or a platform that matches riders with electric scooters. The AI Regulation is certainly the headline act here: it lays out the rules for safe, transparent, and accountable AI across the entire EU, and it applies directly to you, no translation needed into national law. It’s a bit like being handed the recipe for a cake that everyone in Europe has to bake the same way, no matter which kitchen they’re in.

But here’s where things get interesting. Following the AI Regulation is only the first step. Picture compliance as a layered cake—AI Regulation is just that first delicious layer. The moment your system starts handling real people’s data—think route preferences, payment info, or even location history—you’ve got to bring in a whole other set of ingredients: the GDPR. That’s the General Data Protection Regulation, which is really the gold standard for data protection in the EU. Suddenly, you’re not just following the recipe for safe AI—you’re also making sure every ingredient you use is ethically sourced and handled with care.

Now, what does that look like in practice? Well, you need a lawful basis to process any personal data. Sometimes that’s getting explicit consent, other times it’s showing that you have a legitimate reason—either way, you’re expected to keep things minimal and anonymize data wherever possible. And let’s not forget: users have rights. They can ask to see their data, fix mistakes, or even have it deleted altogether. So, you need solid processes to handle these requests—think of it as having a customer service desk, but for privacy.

And that’s not the end of it. There are laws and directives that are tailored to the mobility sector specifically. For instance, the ITS Directive sets the ground rules for intelligent transport systems, while specific Portuguese laws spell out requirements for operating mobility services right here. There’s also EU-level regulation to ensure fair competition and user protection in public transport, which means you have to think beyond just your app or your algorithm—you’re part of a bigger ecosystem.

Oh, and as if that’s not enough, let’s add in a few more layers: the Cybersecurity Act, which is all about keeping your networks secure, and the Digital Services Act, which introduces new duties for digital platforms. These are especially relevant as mobility services become ever more connected and digital.

So, to wrap this all up, compliance in AI-powered urban mobility is a bit like juggling several balls at once—technical, legal, and ethical. It’s not just about ticking boxes for a single regulation, but about building a responsible, trustworthy system that can stand up to scrutiny from all directions. And as technology keeps racing ahead, this holistic approach is what will keep users safe and the market fair.

Coming up next, we’ll zoom in on the specific role of the AMT and how their oversight fits into this broader compliance puzzle. Looking forward to digging into that with you.
