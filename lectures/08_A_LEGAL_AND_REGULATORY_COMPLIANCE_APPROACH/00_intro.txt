Hey everyone, welcome back! Last time, we took a pretty thorough tour through what it really means to approach AI in urban mobility both ethically and strategically. We talked about aligning AI with organizational goals, identifying risks, making sure our data is solid, and—maybe most importantly—keeping equity, human autonomy, and privacy at the forefront. There was also a big emphasis on transparency, legal compliance, and the need for ongoing training and reflection. So, a lot of big ideas that set us up for responsible AI.

Now, in this module, we’re going to zoom in on the legal and regulatory side of things. What does compliance actually look like when it comes to AI in mobility? It’s not just about ticking boxes for AI regulations—we’ll cover the unique regulatory roles of authorities like AMT, dig into the risk-based approach, and look at why certain mobility and transport applications are considered high risk. So, lots of practical, real-world challenges ahead. Let’s get started!
