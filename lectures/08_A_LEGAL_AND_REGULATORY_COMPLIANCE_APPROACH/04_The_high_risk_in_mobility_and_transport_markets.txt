Alright, everyone, let’s jump right in. Last time, we explored the EU’s risk-based approach to regulating AI. Today, we’re zooming in on the high-risk world of mobility and transport.

So, why does AI in this space matter so much? Think of systems running metro trains, orchestrating city-wide traffic lights, or steering massive cargo ships. These are like invisible pilots moving millions safely from A to B. If something fails—a train’s AI misreads a signal or a self-driving bus misjudges a crossing—the consequences are immediate and serious. It’s like being a referee in a championship match: one bad call, and everything can turn upside down.

The EU defines “high-risk” AI in transport quite clearly. Any AI that’s a product or critical safety component—whether controlling a tram, managing an air-traffic system, or directing a rail network—gets the high-risk label by default. This isn’t just about advanced tech; it’s about systems woven deeply into daily life. Think of it as giving these technologies a bright yellow safety vest so they stand out for extra scrutiny.

So, what does high-risk status mean in practice? Before hitting the market, these systems face a conformity assessment—a rigorous pre-deployment check proving they’re not only smart, but safe, reliable, and fair. This covers cybersecurity, accuracy, transparency, and thorough documentation. If the system can’t clear these hurdles, it doesn’t get deployed—simple as that.

Let’s walk through what’s expected from companies. First off, risk management is non-negotiable: they need to hunt down and fix any risks throughout the AI’s entire life. Data quality is another big one—feeding in messy or biased data is like giving bad directions to a driver, and that never ends well. Providers also have to log everything the system does, so if problems pop up, there’s a trail to follow. Transparency is front and center; users should always know what the AI can—and can’t—do. Human oversight is built in, so if things start to go sideways, people can step in and take the wheel. And of course, these systems need to be tough enough to fend off cyber threats and run accurately.

Public authorities have added duties: if they deploy high-risk AI in public transport, they must assess impacts on fundamental rights—privacy, fairness, non-discrimination—before systems go live.

While we’re using the EU as our example, the principle isn’t unique to Europe. Other jurisdictions—like Canada, Singapore, or Australia—also single out transport AI for stricter oversight, even if the categories and processes differ. The underlying logic is the same: where stakes are high, so is the need for accountability.

In short: AI in mobility and transport offers enormous potential—safer roads, faster journeys, smoother networks—but the price of that potential is rigorous oversight. The rules aren’t there to slow innovation down; they’re there to keep it on track, literally and figuratively. In high-risk environments, safety and fairness aren’t optional—they’re the ticket to ride. Thanks for sticking with me through this journey!
